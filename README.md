# DeForms

## Overview

**DeForms** is a decentralized marketplace designed for buying, selling, and trading datasets represented as tokens. By tokenizing datasets, DeForms enhances data credibility, facilitates ownership tracking, and allows for efficient data exchange without the need for intermediaries. Initially, DeForms focuses on survey data, paving the way for scalable, tokenized data marketplaces.

## Problem Statement

Traditional data marketplaces often struggle with:

- **Trust and Data Ownership:** Users must rely on a central authority to manage their data, leading to potential misuse or lack of transparency.
- **Data Quality and Authenticity:** It’s difficult to validate and ensure data provenance.
- **Pricing and Value Assessment:** Determining the value of data is subjective and varies by use case.
- **Transaction Inefficiencies:** Middlemen add costs and slow down transactions.
- **Access and Control:** Users have limited autonomy over their data usage and sharing.
- **Data Silos:** Data sources are fragmented, creating interoperability issues across platforms.

## Solution

DeForms addresses these challenges by leveraging decentralization, tokenization, and smart contracts:

- **Decentralization & Smart Contracts:** Eliminates intermediaries, automating transactions and licensing. Smart contracts provide transparent and secure transactions, ensuring trust.
- **Tokenization of Datasets:** By representing datasets as unique NFTs, DeForms offers clear ownership and provenance tracking. Fractional ownership of these datasets further democratizes access to valuable information.
- **Blockchain Interoperability:** Built on Rootstock, DeForms combines Ethereum’s smart contract functionality with Bitcoin’s network, enhancing security and cross-chain utility.

## Key Features

- **User Interface:** React provides a dynamic, responsive UI.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Ether.js facilitates smooth communication with Ethereum, enabling seamless smart contract interaction and wallet integration.
- **Account Abstraction:** Powered by Privy SDK, onboarding is smooth for both crypto-savvy and non-crypto users.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Create React App
- **Backend:** Supabase for scalable backend services
- **Blockchain:** Rootstock (enables BTC and ETH interoperability)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **Account Abstraction:** Privy SDK
- **Blockchain Interface:** Ether.js

## How to Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Run the App in Development Mode:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser. The page will reload automatically on changes.


3. **Run Tests:** Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

4. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This command compiles the app into an optimized build, minifying files and adding hashes for version control. Output is saved to the build folder.

5. **Custom Configuration::** If you need full control over the build configuration, use:
   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```
   Note: This is a one-way operation and will copy all configuration files and dependencies directly into your project.


## Future Plans

DeForms aims to further enhance its capabilities with the following future developments:

- **Staking Capabilities:** Integration of staking mechanisms that leverage both BTC and ETH networks, allowing users to participate in staking and earn rewards.
- **Support for Additional Data Types:** Expansion to support a variety of data types and datasets beyond survey data, broadening the marketplace’s scope.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality:** Improved interoperability across blockchain networks, allowing seamless interactions between different chains and further enhancing the platform's flexibility.

With these advancements, DeForms aspires to become the leading marketplace for tokenized, high-quality datasets, providing users with a trustworthy, efficient, and versatile platform for data transactions.
